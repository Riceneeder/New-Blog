title: Extraction, structural-activity relationships, bioactivities, and application prospects of Pine pollen polysaccharides as ingredients for functional productsï¼š A review
description: Pine pollen is a nutrient-rich pollen that serves as both a natural medicine and food. It contains abundant proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, and various functional groups. As a key bioactive component in pine pollen, pine pollen polysaccharides exhibit diverse pharmacological activities including anti-tumor effects, liver protection, lipid-lowering properties, anti-inflammatory actions, immune regulation capabilities, antioxidant properties, blood sugar reduction abilities, and antiviral and antibacterial effects. Despite successfully isolating and characterizing pine pollen polysaccharides using multiple extraction and purification techniques, the understanding of their structure-activity relationship, safety profile, and practical applications remains limited. This limitation hinders its potential utilization and development.
